("G-shock GG-1000 Mudmaster Military Beige", 
"This is the latest new addition to the MASTER OF G MUDMASTER Series. Mud Resist construction helps to ensure that nothing gets into the watch when down and dirty work takes you deep into the dirt and sludge. Multiple gaskets are used on the pipes that guide buttons and shafts, which keeps mud out. These pipes not only act to protect buttons from impact, they also enhance button operation.
In addition, Twin Sensor capabilities provide instant access to direction and temperature information when needed under tough conditions.
The face of the watch is marked with large Arabian numerals at 12, 3, 6, and 9 o'clock for easy reading. The face is illuminated by a Super Illuminator, high-brightness auto LED light to ensure high visibility under virtually any conditions imaginable."

("G-Shock GPR-B1000 Rangeman Solar GPS Navigation Black", 
"The new G-Shock Rangeman is the world's first solar-assisted GPS navigation device and also has a Triple Sensor (alti/barometer, compass, thermometer) and Bluetooth connectivity. The watch has a low-temperature LCD display (-20 degreeC, -4 degreeF), sapphire crystal, and carbon fiber insert band for enhanced durability. It is water-resistant to 200 meters and like the original it is resistant to mud and dust.

Another new feature is wireless charging with a USB-powered base station. On a full wireless charge of five hours, the watch can use GPS functions for about 33 hours. Four hours of solar charging in bright sunlight (50,000 lux) will provide about one hour of GPS use. A full charge combined with solar power can up the total usage time to 48 hours. ",

("G-Shock MTG-B1000 Connected Solar Black Blue", 
"This new MTG-B1000 model incorporates a new shock-resistant structure, a smaller case size, and improved fit to the wrist to create a new addition to the MT-G lineup of TRIPLE G RESIST metal-and-resin combination models.
The new shock resistant structure of this model is the result of the G-SHOCK MT-G constant pursuit of improved strength and durability. A New Core Guard structure integrates the lugs and pipes that connect the band into single pieces, creating a wall that isolates the watch's module from impact. The resin of the center case is also reinforced with carbon fibers, which further enhances module protection, while reducing overall weight.
This watch comes with a new Connected Engine module for improved timekeeping accuracy. A Bluetooth communication function makes it possible to connect with a smartphone running the G-SHOCK Connected* app and obtain accurate time information from an on-line time server. MULTIBAND 6 automatically adjusts time settings based on reception of one of six time calibration signals around the globe, for automatic time adjustment when you are within the range of a signal, even if connection with a smartphone is not possible for some reason. All of this means that timekeeping is accurate, no matter where in the world you happen to be.
Other features include high-brightness LED illumination, World Time, stopwatch, and more. Stable operation is ensured by a CASIO original Tough Solar charging system.",

"From G-SHOCK, the watch brand that is constantly setting new standards for timekeeping toughness, comes new coloring models.
Bi-color molding makes it possible to create a new type of band with different colors for the inner and outer surfaces. The inside surface coloring is visible from the sides of the band and through the band holes for an original look. The military motif of these models is highlighted by their coloring, which recalls the inner lining of a flight jacket.
